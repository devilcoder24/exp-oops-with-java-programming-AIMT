The Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with Java Lab is an introductory course designed for students who are new to programming. This lab provides a simple and guided environment to learn the basics of Java, one of the most popular and beginner-friendly programming languages.
Starting with fundamental concepts like variables, operators, data types, and control structures, the lab gradually introduces students to the principles of object-oriented programmingâ€”such as classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation. Each experiment is structured to help students understand both how and why code works, building their confidence and problem-solving skills step by step. By the end of the lab, students will be able to write simple Java programs, understand core programming logic, and take the first step toward building larger applications using object-oriented techniques.Aim of the experiment
